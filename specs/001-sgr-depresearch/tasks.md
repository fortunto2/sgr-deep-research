## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify contract tests fail before implementing endpoints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing `/v1/chat/completions` API
- Use existing agent infrastructure from sgr_deep_research/core/agents/
- Mock external APIs (OpenAI, Tavily) in all tests to avoid costs
- Follow constitutional requirements: TDD, SGR agent support, open source standards

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: 5 OpenAPI endpoints ‚Üí 5 contract test tasks [P]
2. **From Data Model**: 6 entities ‚Üí 6 model creation tasks [P]
3. **From User Stories**: 5 quickstart scenarios ‚Üí 5 integration test tasks [P]
4. **From Research**: Mock testing decisions ‚Üí setup and unit test tasks

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T009)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T015-T020)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (TDD enforced)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Existing API compatibility maintained (no breaking changes)
- [x] Constitutional compliance verified (SGR agents, testing, open source)
